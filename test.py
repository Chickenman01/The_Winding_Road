This is a test of a paragraph thingy

You are a priest in a poor village outside of the city.

One day you are given a golden staff by your mentor

He tells you that it is sacred and can only be wielded by the most powerful of priests

You sell it for 5 copper coins that night to feed your raging alcoholism.
